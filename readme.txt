Yoga Posture Analysis using Deep Learning

Yoga posture analysis is a deep learning project which can detect and analyze the yoga posture of the person using Deep learning and also give a brief about the yoga postures performed by the user in the form of a voice assistant which uses text to speech functionality.

In this project, mainly four algorithms are used for Yoga Posture Analysis which are:
